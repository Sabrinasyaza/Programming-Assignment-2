# Programming-Assignment-2

# FUZZY LOGIC
 Fuzzy logic is a variable processing technique that allows multiple truth values to be processed by the same variable.

# PURPOSE 
The purpose of this programming assignment is to analyze and design a Fuzzy Logic-based system in order to choose 10 best auto mechanics in Bandung. 

# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
We have used the Fuzzy Logic method for this program in order to choose 10 best auto mechanics in Bandung. First and foremost, we have designed a linguistic name for the input and output attributes such as bad, average and best. Next, we have designed the shape and limit of the input membership function. The purpose of membership function is to specifies the degree of the input. Furthemore, we also used inference rules method in order to determine the fuzzy logic output. In addition, we have choose Takagi-Sugeno-Style (Constant Defuzzificatio) as out defuzzification method. The purpose of defuzzification method is to transfrom the output fuzzy value into a single crisp output. Lastly, the shape and limit of the output membership function is the maximum value from each linguitics.
